# Sales_Forecast
Repository containing all steps of the preparation, cleaning, transforming, and pre-processing in R of a historical Rossman dataset (1,000,000> observations) consisting of 1,115 stores. The aim was to predict six weeks of daily sales over the 01/08/2015 - 17/09/2015 period with a linear regression model. Since sales are influenced by a number of factors, backwards step selection was employed to identify the variables which affect sales significantly.
